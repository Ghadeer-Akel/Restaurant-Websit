        <p>Firstly, I found the service to be quite slow and inattentive. Our waiter seemed disinterested in our table and we had to ask multiple times for simple things like water and bread.

          Secondly, while the menu looked promising, the food itself did not live up to expectations. The dishes were bland and lacked seasoning, and the portions were quite small for the price point. Additionally, one of the dishes was served cold, which was disappointing.</p>

        <p>I wanted to commend your staff for their excellent service. Our waiter was attentive and friendly throughout the meal, and helped to make our dining experience a pleasant one.

          In terms of the food, I thought that the appetizers were particularly delicious. The flavor combinations were unique and the presentation was beautiful. However, the main courses were a bit underwhelming. While the ingredients were fresh and high-quality, the dishes lacked the complexity and depth of flavor that I was expecting .</p>
